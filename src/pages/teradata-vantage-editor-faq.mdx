	<summary>Will Vantage Editor provide feature parity with SQL assistant and Teradata Studio?</summary>

<div>
<p>Vantage Editor will NOT provide feature parity with SQL assistant/Studio. Based on customer feedback and user research, it will provide the most critical functionalities that are required for providing an optimal SQL editor.  &nbsp;</p>

<p>
  For users that require more advanced IDEs (integrated development
  environments) for SQL development to complement their Vantage Editor
  experience, they can explore incremental integrations from open ecosystem
  tools and products from 3rd party partners such as the listed below: &nbsp;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Teradata integrations open ecosystem tools: Vantage Modules for Jupyter,
      VS Code SQL Tools Extensions, Visual Studio Tools &nbsp;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3rd Party Teradata Partners: VSCode, DBeaver, Toad, Razor&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As part of our move-forward strategy and being competitive in the market,
  Teradata will continue to expand partnerships to provide modern tools for
  increased flexibility.
</p>

<p>Other open ecosystem and 3rd party tools exist in the marketplace that have been proven to work with Vantage and used by users but are neither provided nor supported by Teradata.</p>

<details open="">
	<summary>Why is Teradata offering a desktop Vantage Editor?</summary>

<div>
<p>As many of our customers transition to the cloud, we know they will live in a Hybrid environment and want to provide a unified customer experience across all our platforms (VantageCloud and VantageCore).  &nbsp;</p>

<p>
  Some of the reasons why customers / users may prefer or require a desktop
  Vantage Editor: &nbsp;
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Need to connect to a Teradata on-premises Vantage Core system. &nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Prefer to connect directly from their computer to Vantage, meaning they prefer dedicated desktop apps in general — Navigating browser tabs gets messy real fast. Nobody needs yet another tab that’s somehow impossible to find when you need it. &nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>As of today, Teradata still has thousands of customers connecting to their systems through SQL Assistant, which is a desktop application. This tells us that this is still a trend among our users.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>

<details open="">
	<summary>Will the Web version of Vantage Editor be available for VantageCore?</summary>

	<summary>Are there major differences when accessing Vantage Editor from Web versus the desktop application? </summary>

<div>
<p>Vantage Editor is one product that can be accessed through different channels (Web, Desktop). Our goal is to provide the same unified experience. This means that the key major capabilities of the SQL Editor product will be available, with only small differences that are applicable to the specific access method. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: In the initial releases of desktop Vantage Editor there may differences in the product, but we will converge these as part of our product roadmap.</p>
</div>
</details>

<details open="">
	<summary>Does Vantage Editor support connectivity to other 3rd Party Databases/DW/Sources such as Oracle, MySQL, hadoop?</summary>

<div>

	<summary>Will SQL assistant continue to be supported and enhanced? </summary>

<div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      SQL Assistant 16.20 will work with DB 17.10, though it will not be able to
      take advantage of any new DB features introduced after 16.20. For
      example: &nbsp;
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cannot configure Federated Authorization &nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>

<details open="">
	<summary>What is the recommended migration strategy from SQL Assistant /Teradata Studio? </summary>

<div>
<p>If you are a SQL Assistant user, we recommend that you don’t migrate to Teradata Studio. Instead, we request you to wait on the Desktop Vantage Editor GA release and migrate directly to Desktop Vantage Editor. To make direct transition from SQL Assistant to Desktop Vantage Editor possible, we have extended support for SQL Assistant until 6 months past the Desktop Vantage Editor GA release. Alternatively, you can also consider 3rd party IDEs that we have partnered with - Razor, Dbeaver / Cloudbeaver, and Toad.</p>

<p>If you’re already in the process of migrating from SQL Assistant to Teradata Studio, we’d like to remind you that Teradata Studio will be nearing end of life by Dec 31, 2025 and you will be required to migrate again to Desktop Vantage Editor in 2025.</p>
</div>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>What are the authentication mechanisms for the Desktop Editor?</summary>

<div>
<p>Currently, LDAP and TD2 are supported mechanisms on Vantage Editor. TD2 is the default Teradata Logon mechanism. Federated SSO will be part of future release.</p>
</div>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Are in- DB functions available in Desktop Editor?</summary>

<div>
<p>The in-DB function explorer, is available in the Web editor to provide easy discovery and execution of the in-DB functions. It is currently not part of the desktop editor for GA - < is this being considered>. However, users can still execute the in-DB functions in the desktop editor by creating their queries with these functions manually. Users need to find such syntax in places such as Teradata docs.</p>
</div>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Are the admin features which were in SQL-A admin version and TD Studio ?</summary>

<div>
<p>We are looking at these, and interview-based research is underway to include them in the future release.</p>
