# Add project collaborators

If you create a project, you are the project owner. If you are the project owner, you can add collaborators to the project. 

The steps depend on whether you do this before or after the engine is deployed.


## Before the engine is deployed

1. In GitHub or GitLab, add users to the project repository.<br/>
See details about adding repo users for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository) or [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/#add-users-to-a-project).

2. When you deploy the engine from your Jupyter notebook, the users are added to the engine automatically.


## After the engine is deployed

1. In GitHub or GitLab, add users to the project repository.<br/>
See details about adding repo users for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository) or [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/#add-users-to-a-project).
2. In your Jupyter notebook, run the magic command `%project_engine_update_users` to add the users to the engine.
