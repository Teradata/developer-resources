CloudFormation templates for the manager are here in the AI Unlimited GitHub repository you cloned:

`/deployments/aws/templates/ai-unlimited/`

Choose a template based on whether your AWS infrastructure uses a [load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-load-balancer) and what type.

    - `ai-unlimited-with-alb.yaml`&mdash;Hosts the manager behind an [application load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-application-load-balancer)
    - `ai-unlimited-with-nlb.yaml`&mdash;Hosts the manager behind a [network load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-network-load-balancer)
    - `ai-unlimited-without-lb.yaml`&mdash;No load balancer
