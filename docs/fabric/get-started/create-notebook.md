# Create an AI Unlimited notebook from your workspace

![ImgCreateNotebook](./create-notebook.svg)

Once the AI Unlimited Workload has been added to the capacity for your workspace, you can create an AI Unlimited notebook.
1.	Within the workspace, select “+ New item.”
2.	Scroll down to “Prepare data” or “Analyze and train data” to find and create the notebook.

You will be prompted to name the notebook. For consistency with these directions, name the notebook “data_prep.”


## Create the sample notebook

After naming your notebook, select the “Sample data preparation” tile to pre-populate the notebook with a data preparation use case that demonstrates AI Unlimited in-database functions against sample data to evaluate large data sets, create fit tables, and normalize data.
