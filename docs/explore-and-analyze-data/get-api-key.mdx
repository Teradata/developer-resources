# Get your API key

Each time you open a new notebook to create or access a project, you'll need your [API key.](../glossary.md#api-key) It connects your notebook to the [AI Unlimited manager](../glossary.md#ai-unlimited-manager). 

Your API key, available from your user profile in the manager, stays the same for the lifetime of the AI Unlimited installation.

1. Use the URL provided by your AI Unlimited admin to access the manager.
:::note
Your AI Unlimited admin is the person at your organization who set up AI Unlimited.

2. Sign in to GitHub or GitLab, and authenticate yourself.
3. After being routed back to the manager, on your **Profile**, copy your API key.

Keep your API key. Or go back to your **Profile** anytime to get it.
