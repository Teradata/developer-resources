# Magic commands

In Jupyter notebooks, magic commands are shortcuts for common tasks. The AI Unlimited magic commands enable you to connect to the engine and manage projects.

The AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel supports the magic commands described here&mdash;in addition to the standard Teradata SQL kernel magic commands. 


## %workspaces_config

**Description**: Establish communication between your notebook and the AI Unlimited manager.

**Usage**:
```bash 
%workspaces_config host=<ip_or_hostname>, apikey=<API_Key>, withtls=<T|F>
```
Where:

- host:  Name or IP address of the AI Unlimited manager.

- apikey: API key value from the AI Unlimited setup **Profile** page.

- **`[Optional]`** withTLS: If False (F), the default client-server communication does not use TLS.

**Output**:
```
Workspace configured for host=<ip_or_hostname>
```

## %project_create

**Description**: Create a new project. This command also creates a new repository with the project name in your Git account. The configurations are stored in the **engine.yml** file.

**Usage**:
```bash
%project_create project=<Project_Name>, env=<Cloud_Service_Provider>, team=<Project_Team>
```
Where:

- project: Name of the project to be created.

- env: Cloud environment where the project is hosted. For the current release, AWS and Azure are supported.

- **`[Optional]`** team: Name of the team collaborating on the project.

**Output**:
```
Project `Project_Name` created
```

## %project_delete

**Description**: Delete the project. This does not remove the project repository. It removes project metadata from the manager. 

**Usage**:
```bash 
%project_delete project=<Project_Name>, team=<Project_Team>
```

Where:

- project: Name of the project to be deleted.

- **`[Optional]`** team: Name of the team collaborating on the project.

**Output**:
```
Project `Project_Name` deleted
```

## %project_list

**Description**: List the details of one or all projects.

Use the project parameter to get the details of a specific project. All the projects are listed if you run the command without any parameters.

**Usage**:
```bash
%project_list project=<Project_Name>
```
Where:

- project: The project name.

**Output**:

```
| NAME          | URL      | 
|---------------|----------|
| <Project_Name>| <Git_URL>| 

```

## %project_auth_create

**Description**: Create an authorization object to store object store credentials.

You must create the authorization object before deploying the engine. The authorization details are retained and are included while redeploying the project. Optionally, you can create authorizations manually using the `CREATE AUTHORIZATION` SQL command after deploying the engine. In this case, the authorization details are not retained.

**Usage**:
```bash 
%project_auth_create project=<Project_Name>, name=<Authorization_Name>, key=<Authorization_Key>, secret=<Authorization_Secret>, region=<ObjectStore_Region>, token=<Session_Token>
```
Where:

- project: Name of the project.

- name:	Authorization name for the object store.

- key: Authorization key of the object store.

- **`[Optional]`** secret: Authorization secret access ID of the object store.

- **`[Optional]`** region: Region of the object store; local for the local object store.

- **`[Optional]`** token: Session token for the object store access.

- **`[Optional-AWS Only]`** role: IAM users or service account to access AWS resources from an AWS account by assuming a role and its entitlements. The owner of the AWS resource defines the role. For example: arn:aws:iam::00000:role/STSAssumeRole.

- **`[Optional-AWS Only]`** ExternalID: External ID used to access object store. This parameter is required when using the `role` parameter.

**Output**:
```
Authorization 'name' created
```

## %project_auth_update

**Description**: Update an object store authorization.

**Usage**:

```bash 
%project_auth_update project=<Project_Name>, name=<Authorization_Name>, key=<Authorization_Key>, secret=<Authorization_Secret>, region=<ObjectStore_Region>, token=<Session_Token>

```
Where:

- project: Name of the project.

- name: Authorization name for the object store.

- key: Authorization key of the object store.

- **`[Optional]`** secret: Authorization secret access ID of the object store.

- **`[Optional]`** region: Region of the object store; local for the local object store.

- **`[Optional]`** token: Session token for the object store access.

- **`[Optional-AWS Only]`** role: IAM users or service account to access AWS or Azure resources from a CSP account by assuming a role and its entitlements. The owner of the AWS or Azure resource defines the role. For example: arn:aws:iam::00000:role/STSAssumeRole.

- **`[Optional-AWS Only]`** ExternalID: External ID used to access object store. This parameter is required when using the `role` parameter.

**Output**:
```
Authorization 'name' updated
```

## %project_auth_delete

**Description**: Remove an object store authorization.

**Usage**:
```bash
%project_auth_delete project=<Project_Name>, name=<Authorization_Name>
```
Where:

- project: Name of the project.

- name:	Authorization name for the object store.

**Output**:
```
Authorization 'name' deleted
```

## %project_auth_list

**Description**: List object store authorizations that are created for a project.

**Usage**:
```bash 
%project_auth_list project=<Project_Name>

```
Where:

- project: Name of the project.

**Output**:
```
| AUTH NAME           | ACCESS KEY  | SECRET  | 
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| <Authorization_Name>| <ACCESS_KEY>| <SECRET>| 
```

## %project_engine_deploy
