# Install the manager on AWS

Before you begin, make sure you have the [prerequisites](./index.md#prerequisites) and your AWS account meets [the requirements](../resources/aws-requirements.md).

The AI Unlimited manager orchestrates the engine's deployment and includes a web-based user interface for setup. 

You'll use a CloudFormation template provided by Teradata to install the manager from the AWS Management Console. You'll deploy a server instance, on which the manager runs in a container controlled by [systemd](../glossary.md#systemd).

:::tip
For installation help, email the <a href="mailto:aiunlimited.support@Teradata.com">support team</a> or ask the [community](https://support.teradata.com/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=b0aba91597c329d0e6d2bd8c1253affa).
:::


## Clone the repository

import MyPartial from '../_partials/_clone-repo.mdx';

<MyPartial />


## Locate the manager template

CloudFormation templates for the manager are here in the AI Unlimited GitHub repository:

`deployments/aws/templates/ai-unlimited/`

Choose a template based on whether you intend to use a [load balancer](../glossary.md#load-balancer).
:::note
You might want to ask a cloud admin at your organization for guidance.
:::
    - `ai-unlimited-with-nlb.yaml`&mdash;Hosts the manager behind a [network load balancer](../glossary.md#network-load-balancer)
    - `ai-unlimited-without-lb.yaml`&mdash;No load balancer. If you're unsure about which template to use, we recommend this one.


## Load the template	

1. Sign in to the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com).<br />
   :::note
   References to AWS Management Console are up-to-date as of May 29, 2024.
   ::: 
2. Select the AWS region in which to deploy AI Unlimited.<br />
We recommend selecting the region closest to your primary work location.
3. Search for and go to **CloudFormation**.
4. Select **Create Stack**, then **With new resources (standard)**.
5. Select **Choose an existing template**, then **Upload a template file**.
6. Select the template file you chose to use, and click **Next**.

## Specify stack details and options

1. Provide a stack name.
2. Review the parameters. Provide values for the required parameters. Your organization might require others.<br/>

<summary>AWS and manager parameters</summary>

 The parameters for each template vary. You might see some parameters here that you don't see in the console.
 
| Parameter | Description | Notes | 
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Stack name	| The identifier that helps you find the AI Unlimited stack from a list of stacks. |Required<br/>Default: NA<br/> The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case-sensitive) and hyphens.

| InstanceType | The EC2 instance type for the manager. |Required with default<br/>Default: t3.micro<br/> **IMPORTANT**: If the instance is not adequately sized, engine deploy and suspend failures may occur, and you will have to re-install the manager on a larger instance.  See *Learn more: Manager instance type (size) recommendations* below the parameters section. |
| RootVolumeSize | The size of the root disk you want to attach to the instance, in GB. | Required with default<br/>Default: 20<br/>Supports values between 8 and 1000. |

|IamRoleName | The name of the IAM role to assign to the instance, either an existing IAM role or a  newly created one. |Optional with default<br/>Default: ai-unlimited-iam-role<br/>If naming a new IAM role, CloudFormation requires the CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability. Leave this blank to use an autogenerated name. |
|IamPermissionsBoundary	| The ARN of the IAM permissions boundary to associate with the IAM role assigned to the instance. |Optional<br/>Default: NA |
|AvailabilityZone | The availability zone to which you want to deploy the instance. |Required<br/>Default: NA<br/>The value must match the subnet, the zone of any pre-existing volumes, and the instance type must be available in the selected zone. |

Therefore, Internet-facing load balancers can route requests from clients over the Internet.<br/>The nodes of an internal load balancer have only private IP addresses. The DNS name of an internal load balancer is publicly resolvable to the personal IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, internal load balancers can route requests from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer.|

|HostedZoneID | The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone when you created it.|Optional<br/>Default: NA<br/>Each hosted zone corresponds to a domain name, or possibly a subdomain. The hosted zone is the container for DNS records, where you configure how the world interacts with your domain, such as pointing it to an IP address with a record.<br/>On the AWS console, go to **Route 53** > **Hosted zones**. Find your registered domain name and the corresponding Hosted zone ID.|

|AccessCIDR	|The CIDR IP address range that is permitted to access the instance. |Optional<br/>Default: NA<br/>We recommend setting this value to a trusted IP range. Define at least one of AccessCIDR, PrefixList, or SecurityGroup to allow inbound traffic unless you create custom security group ingress rules.|
|PrefixList	|The prefix list you can use to communicate with the instance. It is a collection of CIDR blocks that define a set of IP address ranges that require the same policy enforcement.|Optional<br/>Default: NA<br/>Define at least one of AccessCIDR, PrefixList, or SecurityGroup to allow inbound traffic unless you create custom security group ingress rules. Make sure to enter the prefix list name, not the ID.|

<summary>Learn more: Manager instance type (size) recommendations</summary>

For the AI Unlimited paid public preview, based on quantity of concurrent engine deploy and suspend operations, we recommend these t3 instance types. The performance of the other available instance types may vary.

| Instance type | Concurrent operations |
|---------|-------------|
|t3.micro |1 |
|t3.small |up to 5 |
|t3.medium |up to 10 |
|t3.large |up to 20 |
|t3.xlarge |more than 21 

The concurrency will increase when AI Unlimited is released for general availability.

<summary>Learn more: Using a persistent volume</summary>

The manager instance runs in a container and saves its configuration data in a database in the root volume of the instance. This data persists if you shut down, restart, or snapshot and relaunch the instance. 

A persistent volume stores data for a containerized application beyond the lifetime of the container, pod, or node in which it runs. 


**Without a persistent volume**

If the container, pod, or node crashes or terminates, you lose the manager's configuration data. You can deploy a new manager instance, but not to the same state as the one that was lost.


**With a persistent volume**

If the container, pod, or node crashes or terminates, and the manager's configuration data is stored in a persistent volume, you can deploy a new manager instance that has the same configuration as the one that was lost.


**Example**

1. Deploy the manager, and include these parameters:
   - `UsePersistentVolume`: **New**
   - `PersistentVolumeDeletionPolicy`: **Retain**
2. After you create the stack, on the **Outputs** tab, note the `volume-id`.
3. Use AI Unlimited.
4. If the manager instance is lost, deploy the manager again, and include these parameters:
   - `UsePersistentVolume`: **New**
   - `PersistentVolumeDeletionPolicy`: **Retain** 
   - `ExistingPersistentVolumeId`: the value you noted in step 2
   
 The new manager instance has the same configuration as the one that was lost.

</details>


3. Select **Next**.
4. [Configure stack options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html) based on your needs, then select **Next**. 


## Review and create the stack

1. Review the template settings. 
2. Select the checkbox to acknowledge that the template will create IAM resources. 
3. Select **Submit** to deploy the stack.<br />
On the **Events** tab, you can monitor progress. When the status of all the resources is `CREATE_COMPLETE`, the manager is ready. 

The **Outputs** tab shows the values generated for the created resources.

You'll need the URL to access the manager and set up AI Unlimited.
