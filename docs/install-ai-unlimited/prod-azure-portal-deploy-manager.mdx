# Install the manager on Azure

Before you begin, make sure you have the [prerequisites](./index.mdx#prerequisites) and your Azure account meets [the requirements](../resources/azure-requirements.mdx).

The AI Unlimited manager orchestrates the engine's deployment and includes a web-based user interface for setup.

You'll use an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template provided by Teradata to install the manager from the Azure Portal. You'll deploy a server instance, on which the manager runs in a container controlled by [systemd](../glossary.mdx#systemd).

:::tip
For installation help, email the <a href="mailto:aiunlimited.support@Teradata.com">support team</a> or ask the [community](https://support.teradata.com/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=b0aba91597c329d0e6d2bd8c1253affa).

## Clone the repository

import MyPartial from '../_partials/_clone-repo.mdx';

## Locate the manager template

ARM templates for the manager are here in the AI Unlimited GitHub repository:

`deployments/azure/templates/arm/ai-unlimited`

Choose a template based on whether you intend to use a [load balancer](../glossary.mdx#load-balancer) and what type.
:::note
You might want to ask a cloud admin at your organization for guidance.
::: - `ai-unlimited-with-alb.json`&mdash;Hosts the manager behind an [application load balancer](../glossary.mdx#application-load-balancer) - `ai-unlimited-with-nlb.json`&mdash;Hosts the manager behind a [network load balancer](../glossary.mdx#network-load-balancer) - `ai-unlimited-without-lb.json`&mdash;No load balancer. If you're unsure about which template to use, we recommend this one.

## Load the template

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   :::note
   References to Azure Portal are up-to-date as of May 29, 2024.
   :::
2. Search for **custom deployment**, then select **Deploy a custom template**.
3. Select **Build your own template in the editor**, then **Load file**.
4. Select the template file you chose to use, then select **Save**.

<summary>Learn more: Using a persistent volume</summary>

The manager instance runs in a container and saves its configuration data in a database in the root volume of the instance. This data persists if you shut down, restart, or snapshot and relaunch the instance.

A persistent volume stores data for a containerized application beyond the lifetime of the container, pod, or node in which it runs.

**Without a persistent volume**

If the container, pod, or node crashes or terminates, you lose the manager's configuration data. You can deploy a new manager instance, but not to the same state as the one that was lost.

**With a persistent volume**

If the container, pod, or node crashes or terminates, and the manager's configuration data is stored in a persistent volume, you can deploy a new manager instance that has the same configuration as the one that was lost.

**Example**

1. Deploy the manager, and set the `Use Persistent Volume` parameter to **New**.
2. After you create the stack, on the **Outputs** page, note the `volume-id`.
3. Use AI Unlimited.
4. If the manager instance is lost, deploy the manager again, and include these parameters:
   - `Use Persistent Volume`: **New**
   - `Existing Persistent Volume`: the value you noted in step 2

The new manager instance has the same configuration as the one that was lost.

</details>

## Create the instance

1. Select **Review + create**.
2. Select **Create**.<br />
   On the **Notifications** page, you can monitor progress.

When deployment is complete, the **Outputs** page shows values generated for the created resources.

You'll need the URL to access the manager and set up AI Unlimited.

## What's next

[Create an OAuth app](../resources/create-oauth-app.mdx) to allow authentication between AI Unlimited and your Git provider account.
