  title: Teradata Query Service
  version: '@projectVersion@'
  description: |

    The Query Service is a RESTful web service for Teradata-supported databases that allows web pages, mobile devices,
    and scripting languages to query a Teradata-supported database using HTTP as the wire protocol and JSON as the data
    interchange format. Since support for HTTP and JSON is available in most programming languages, applications can use
    this service to access a Teradata-supported database without requiring a driver.

    This service offers a large number of API's, but most applications will only need to use the
    `POST /system/[systemName]/queries` API. This API enables you to submit a query and get back the response in a
    single API call. Several examples of this API are presented below, but first let's cover some information common
    to all Query Service REST API endpoints.

    ### HTTP Headers

    There are several HTTP headers that must be submitted along with each request and some that are optional.

    | Header  | Value | Description | Required |
    | ------- | ----- | ----------- | -------- |
    | Authorization | Bearer TOKEN | Contains an access token issued by the Query Service | One of these two is required
    | Authorization | Basic _\[Base64 encoded "username:password"\]_ | Contains the credentials used to access the Teradata Database. The Authorization header is constructed as follows: 1.  Username and password are combined into a string "username:password" 2.  The resulting string is then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to 76 char/line 3.  The authorization method and a space i.e. "Basic " is then put before the encoded string. | One of these two is required
    | Accept | application/[vnd.com](http://vnd.com).teradata.rest-v1.0+json | Instructs the web service that the client wants to use the 1.0 version of the REST API for Teradata Database. Ensures backwards compatibility if the REST API ever changes. | Yes |
    | Accept-Encoding | gzip | Instructs the web service to GZIP compress the response. If omitted, the response will be returned without compression. | No |
    | Content-Type | application/json | Instructs the web service that the request contains JSON data. | Yes |

    ### Status Codes

    Each HTTP Response will contain a status code as listed in the table below.

    | Code | Definition | Description |
    | ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
    | 200 | OK | The request was successful. |
    | 201 | Created | The request was successful and the response contains the created object info |
    | 400 | Bad Request | The request could not be understood by the service due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications. |
    | 401 | Unauthorized | The request requires user authentication. |
    | 404 | Not Found | The resource referenced by the specified URI was not found. |
    | 412 | Precondition Failed | The specified session is currently in use or there are no available threads to execute the request and the queue timeout is exceeded. |
    | 420 | Database Error | The target Teradata Database returned an error. |
    | 429 | Too Many Sessions | The user has already reached the session limit. |
    | 500 | Internal Server Error | The service encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. |

    When the status code is not `200 OK` or `201 Created` the response body will contain a JSON response containing an error message and possibly an error code returned by the target database.

    ```json
    {
      "error":"3802",
      "message":"Database 'MyDatabase' does not exist.",
    }
    ```

    ## Submitting SQL statements

    To submit an SQL request to a Teradata Database using this web service, you send a POST request
    to the `/system/[systemName]/queries` API endpoint, replacing `[systemName]` with the nickname
    of a system that has been defined by an administrator using the System Service.

    ### Result Set Formats

    The format of the response to an SQL request depends on the requested format.
    Three formats are supported: **_object_**, **_array_**, and **_csv_**.
    Both **_object_** and **_array_** options generate JSON responses, while
    the **_csv_** option generates a comma separated value response.

    #### JSON Object

    JSON Object is the default result format. This format creates a JSON object
    per row with the column names as the field names and the column values as
    the field values.

    ```bash
    curl --insecure -X POST \
    "$HOST:1443/api/query/systems/prod/queries" \
    -H 'Accept: application/vnd.com.teradata.rest-v1.0+json, */*; q=0.01' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H "Authorization: Basic ZGJjOmRiYw==' \
    -d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM dbc.dbcinfo"}'
    ```

    In the example above, we are submitting a `SELECT * FROM DBC.DBCInfo` query
    to the system nicknamed "prod" and using TD2 authentication with the username
    and password "dbc" ("ZGJjOmRiYw==" is "dbc:dbc" Base64 encoded). The results will be
    returned in the default `JSON Object` format:

    ```json
    {
      "queryDuration": 45,
      "queueDuration": 3,
      "results": [
      {
        "data": [
        {
          "InfoData": "16.20.00.00",
          "InfoKey": "VERSION"
        },
        {
          "InfoData": "Japanese",
          "InfoKey": "LANGUAGE SUPPORT MODE"
        },
        {
          "InfoData": "16.20.00.00",
          "InfoKey": "RELEASE"
        }
        ],
        "resultSet": true,
        "rowCount": 3,
        "rowLimitExceeded": false
      }
      ]
    }
    ```

    The JSON object response contains the following fields:

    * **queueDuration**
      How long the request was queued in milliseconds.
    * **queryDuration**
      How long the request ran once submitted in milliseconds.
    * **results**
      An array of the result sets, update counts produced by the submitted SQL.
      The array will have more than one element if the submitted SQL contains
      more than one statement or if a stored procedure was called that
      returns more than one result set. The following fields may be present
      inside of a result array element.
      *   resultSet - Indicates if the result is a result set (true) or an update count (false).
      *   columns - Contains an array of the columns comprising the result set. Each column contains a name and type field containing the column's name and SQL type respectively (only present if resultSet is true and include_columns was true when the request was submitted).
      *   outParams - An object of key value pairs representing the output parameters from a stored procedure.
      *   data - Contains the data produced by the query. The format depends on the value of the format attribute specified with the request (e.g. an array of arrays, or an array of objects). The data field is only present when resultSet is true.
      *   rowCount - If a result set, the number of rows returned up to the row limit if set, else the update count.
      *   rowLimitExceeded - Flags if the number of rows in the result exceeded the number of rows specified in the rowLimit.

    * **responseError**
      This field will typically not be present. It is only present if an error occurs while the query is in the RESPONDING state. In this case, a successful status would have already been sent to the client, which is why any responseErrors are included as the last field in the JSON response.

    #### JSON Array

    The JSON Array format is similar to JSON object format except instead of a JSON object per row, there is a JSON
    array per row where each column value is an element in the array.

    ```bash
    curl --insecure -X POST \
    "$HOST:1443/api/query/systems/prod/queries" \
    -H 'Accept: application/vnd.com.teradata.rest-v1.0+json, */*; q=0.01' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H "Authorization: Basic ZGJjOmRiYw==' \
    -d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM dbc.dbcinfo", "format": "array", "include_columns": true }'
    ```
    The request above demonstrates several availble options:

    * The response will be in JSON array format ("format": "array") .
    * The response will include column information ("include_columns": true).

    Here are sample results:
    ```json
    {
      "queryDuration": 11,
      "queueDuration": 3,
      "results": [
      {
        "columns": [
        {
          "name": "InfoKey",
          "type": "VARCHAR"
        },
        {
          "name": "InfoData",
          "type": "VARCHAR"
        }
        ],
        "data": [
          [
          "VERSION",
          "16.20.00.00"
          ],
          [
            "LANGUAGE SUPPORT MODE",
            "Japanese"
            ],
          [
            "RELEASE",
            "16.20.00.00"
            ]
          ],
        "resultSet": true,
        "rowCount": 3,
        "rowLimitExceeded": false
      }
      ]
    }
    ```

    #### Comma Separated Value (CSV)

    CSV format does not contain any meta data about the response and simply contains the query results. The
    response contains a line for each row where each line contains the row's column values separated by a comma.

    ```bash
    curl --insecure -X POST \
    "$HOST:1443/systems/prod/queries" \
    -H 'Accept: application/vnd.com.teradata.rest-v1.0+json, */*; q=0.01' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H "Authorization: Basic ZGJjOmRiYw==' \
    -d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM dbc.dbcinfo", "format": "csv", "include_columns": true}'
    ```

    The output for CSV format will look like this:
    ```
    InfoKey,InfoData
    VERSION,16.20.00.00
    LANGUAGE SUPPORT MODE,Japanese
    RELEASE,16.20.00.00
    ```
    The first row contains the column names (because we requested `include_columns`).

    ### Managing Database Sessions

    There are two ways that database sessions are created by the Query Service. The first way is when a client
    submits a query without referencing a session ID. If an idle session does not already exist for the
    specified credentials, a new session is created based on the default settings configured for the target
    system. This type of session is called an **_implicit_** session. The second way a session is created is if
    a client calls `POST /system/[systemName]/sessions` to open a session. This type of session is called
    an **_explicit_** session.

    Each session remains open until the session is idle for the configured maxIdleTime or until closed by
    calling `DELETE /system/[systemName]/sessions/[sessionId]`. Implicit sessions are reused if they are
    idle and if the credentials specified by the client are the same as when the session was created. If
    there are no sessions that match that criteria, then a new implicit session can be created, up to the
    maximum number of implicit sessions allowed per user. If the maximum number of implicit sessions are
    reached and none are idle, then the request will be queued.

    Explicit sessions are only used if a client references them in a query request. If a request references
    an explicit session that is already in use, the request will be queued. Explicit sessions should be used
    when a transaction needs to span multiple requests or when using volatile tables
