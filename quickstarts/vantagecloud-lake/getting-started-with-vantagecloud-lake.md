### Database credentials

Fill out the Database credential fields:

| **Item**           | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DBC password | The primary administrative account in a Teradata Vantage environment is known as "dbc". Similar to the root user in Linux, the dbc account holds comprehensive administrative privileges. It is recommended to establish additional administrative users for routine tasks, after the environment is created, and to refrain from sharing or utilizing the dbc credentials. |

Set the password for dbc: 
* Between 8 and 64 characters 
* Allows both alphanumeric and special characters 
* No dictionary words

### Advanced options

To quickly get started, you can select **Use Defaults** or define the additional option settings.

![Advanced option with user default](../images/lake_advanced_option_default.png)



```mdx-code-block
| *Item*           |Description*                                                                                   |

| AMPs per instance       | Workload management + Select the number of AMPs per instance for the instance size you selected. |
| AWS: Storage encryption | Configure encryption for customer data. See [Finding the key ID and key ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/find-cmk-id-arn.html) <br/> <ul><li>Managed by Teradata</li><li>Customer managed</li><li>Key Alias ARN</li></ul>  |

```

![Advanced option user defined](../images/lake_advanced_option.png)

Review all the information and click on **CREATE ENVIRONMENT** button.

![Create environment button](../images/lake_create_environment.png)

The deployment takes few minutes. Once complete, created environment can be found in **Environments** section as a card view(name of environment is quickstart_demo). 

![Newly created available environment](../images/lake_available_environment.png)

## Access environment from public internet

The created environment is accessible through console only. To change that, click on created environment and go to *SETTINGS* tab.

![Settings menu of created environment](../images/lake_settings_menu.png)

In the **SETTINGS**, select the **Internet connection** checkbox and provide the IP addresses in CIDR format (for example, 192.168.2.0/24 specifies all IP addresses in the range: 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255) with which you would want to access your environment.
